### Word-Guesser Game

This is a WIP game based on the popular internet craze Wordle. This version allows the user to customize the length of the word to guess as well as the number of guesses allotted, allowing for varying difficulties and most importantly infinite play instead of the once-per-day approach of Wordle.
